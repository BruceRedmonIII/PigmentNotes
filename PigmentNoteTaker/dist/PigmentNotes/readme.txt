This tool takes everything from the PigmentSaveFile.txt file and turns it into a pigment class
It stores them in a pigment dictionary so that the names of the pigment objects are the codes of the pigment
It will start by asking the code you want to search, right now its just 781 and 122, and then
ask you what option you would like to do. If you choose to edit the code, it will locate the 
value you want to edit, and then resave the file so it will update to what you changed afterwards
This is still a rough draft and I still have a few feautures I want to add to it
but it does work for what I need it to do.
